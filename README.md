# algo-datastruct

Student name: Aditya Iqbal Bagaskara
University: Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia
Course: Algorithm and Data Structure class (ICS0005)
Instructure: Jaanus PÃ¶ial

The courses and homeworks teaches me about basic understanding of algorithm and data structure. The course uses Java 8 as the main language of the course and homeworks. Tests are created by the instructure to test the homework. The part of student's work can be found in the file under src directory inside a* directory (Homework folders)

Content of each homework:

a0. First homework. Getting familiar with Java

a1. Sorting goat and sheep. This implementation emphasizes on stability.

a2. Implementation of binary insertion sort. Binary insertion sort is an insertion sort in which the insertion point is searched using binary search. It is faster than regular insertion sort.

a3. Implementation of abstract data type to interpret Polish Reverse Notation (Postfix) using stack

a4. Implementation of abstract data type "Quaternion" according to http://enos.itcollege.ee/%7Ejpoial/algorithms/quat/
